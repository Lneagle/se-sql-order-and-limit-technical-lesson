# Technical Lesson: Ordering and Limiting Data with SQL

A software engineer at a company selling model cars and planes may need to use these SQL skills frequently 
to analyze sales data and inventory. They might use `ORDER BY` to sort sales figures by date (`ASC`) or to 
rank top-selling products (`DESC`). `LIMIT` could be applied when generating reports to show only the top 10 
bestsellers or the 5 least popular items. Filtering and ordering with SQL would be crucial for tasks like 
identifying trends in specific product categories, analyzing sales performance across different time periods, 
or managing inventory levels. These techniques allow the data scientist to extract focused, relevant insights 
from large datasets to support business decisions.

## Set Up

* Fork and Clone the GitHub Repo.
* Install dependencies and enter the virtual environment:
  * `pipenv install`
  * `pipenv shell`
* You will run your code using `python3 main.py` as you work through the technical lesson.

## Instructions

### Part 1: The Data

### Part 2: `ORDER BY`

### Part 3: `LIMIT`

## Summary

In this lesson, you expanded your SQL knowledge by learning how to sort and limit the results of your query
using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`. You also saw how to customize the sorting behavior as well as incorporate 
`DISTINCT` and `WHERE` keywords to create more-sophisticated queries.
